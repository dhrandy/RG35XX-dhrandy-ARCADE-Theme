# RG35XX dhrandy-ARCADE Theme
This is a them I modified for the Anbernic RG35XX based on an arcade. I don't take credit for being the original creator, you can see the original theme link at the bottom of this page.  You need to be using Garlic OS on your RG35XX for this theme to work.

## Installation - *This only works with Garlic OS

2. Open your CFW folder on your main RG35XX sd card. (It's the same SD card that has your Garlic OS installation).

## Notes
By downloading this file you take all responsibility for messing up your Anbernic RG35XX.  I am not held responsible. I can't guarantee this works with all versions of Garlic OS. Be sure to backup your current them in the skin folder!  You don't need the CFW folder on the second SD card.

Garlic OS screenshots are saved in: CFW\retroarch\.retroarch\screenshots
