# RG35XX dhrandy-ARCADE Theme
This is a them I modified for the Anbernic RG35XX based on an arcade. I don't take credit for being the original creator, you can see the original theme link at the bottom of this page.  You need to be using Garlic OS on your RG35XX for this theme to work.

## Installation - *This only works with Garlic OS
1. Open your CFW folder on your RG35XX sd card. (It's the same SD card that has your Garlic OS installation).
2. Make a backup copy of your current skin folder.  If this theme doesn't work you can revert back.
3. Copy the downloaded skin folder over the existing skin folder.
